# Resource names are truncated to 47 characters. Kubernetes allows 63 characters
# limit for resource names. When pods for deployments are created they have
# additional 16 characters suffix, e.g. "-957c9d6ff-pkzgw" and we want to have
# room for those suffixes.
#
# NOTE: All values under resource key need to be used with `tpl` to render them
# correctly in the templates. This is because helm doesn't template values.yaml
# file and it has to be a valid json. Example usage:
#
#     {{ tpl .Values.resource.default.name . }}.
